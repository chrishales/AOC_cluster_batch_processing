These scripts will get you running batch mode processes on the NRAO AOC cluster in no time.

To get started, look in batch.bash and set the user inputs.

The code illustrates batch processing where CASA is used for some of the analysis (the most likely use case). To run a demonstration, simply modify ```MYUSERNAME``` and ```WORK_DIR``` in batch.bash, place wrapper.bash and casa_script.py in ```WORK_DIR```, and start batch.bash from anywhere on nmpost-master (e.g. home directory).
